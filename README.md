I enjoy doing riddles and puzzles. I especially have grown fond of Advent Of Code and LeetCode, though less Leetcode I will probably make
another repo for the problems on that site.
I want to learn to use Rust profeciently, so I am using that, I understand that doing simple puzzles only get you so far in learning a language though I am insistant that 
some coding is better than none.

I will also learn different IDEs doing these tasks, for the forseeable future however, NVIM is proving quite good.
All this while also trying to use ChatGPT as a simple instructor to small problems, aka:
"How do I make a matrix in Rust" and not print the entire question to it.
